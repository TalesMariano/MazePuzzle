Duration: 4 hours
 
Part 1: Generate a 2d random maze in an X by X grid and render it in Unity, with entrance at 0,0 and exit at X,X.  Some tips:
- Don't worry about rendering performance or optimization. You can just render the walls as a bunch of planes.
- There should only be one entrance and one exit.
- The maze should look ‘maze-like’, so it’s not just a big open space, but has winding passageways and twists and turns.  

Part 2: Create an object that will pathfind to any clicked grid position in the maze.
